This is the official Pytorch implementation of *Adversarial Open Domain Adaption for Sketch-to-Photo Synthesis*.

#### [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.05703)

## Updates
- 2021.4.15: Create the repo

## Introduction
The repository contains the entire project (including all the preprocessing) for our open domain sketch-to-photo synthesis. Currently it is still under construction.

## Prerequisites
- Linux or macOS
- Python 3 (Recommend to use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#linux))
- CPU or NVIDIA GPU + CUDA CuDNN


## Get Started
### Installation 
Install the required packages: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

### Download Pretrained Weights
Please download the weights from [GoogleDrive], and put it into the [weights/](weights/) folder.
